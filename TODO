- More integration specs
- NFA -> DFA minimization using the subset construction algorithm (or another, if there is one).
  - Integration tests should be matching against both the DFA + NFA matching techniques
- Google Protocol buffer output for DFA state table. Conversion of the buffer to a regex.
- Unicode support
- Empty regexs (//) should be matched by an empty string
- Get rid of NFA transition table in favor of DFA transition table
