- More integration specs
- Integration tests should be matching against both the DFA + NFA matching techniques
- DFA minimization
- Unicode support
- Empty regexs (//) should be matched by an empty string
- Google Protocol buffer output for DFA state table. Conversion of the buffer to a regex.  Waiting on Antelope (or should that support go into antelope?)
